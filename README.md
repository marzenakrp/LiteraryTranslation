# Translating World Literature at a Paragraph-Level

[![arxiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2304.03245-b31b1b.svg)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03245)

This is the official repositor for evaluation data from "Large language models effectively leverage document-level context for literary translation, but critical errors persist" (check out our [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03245) for details).

UPDATE: Currently (May 5th, 2023) finishing translating and cleaning comments which were made in Polish/Japanese. v1 of the dataset should be available soon. We are working on v2 where a severity level will be added. If you do not wish to wait for that a rule of thumb would be to convert all mistranslations into "major" errors, and other types of errors into "minor" errors (though this will backfire in some case). More information and DATASHEETS coming soon.
