Another one \"lantern\" in T2 is closer in translation than \"flashlight\" in T1 because somebody was waving it. I don't think you can say \"wave\" about a flashlight, a lantern actually has a handle that you hold, and wave it to show your location. Not sure if I should mark \"flashlight\" as a mistranslation since it is not a huge mistake and I guess can be used as a synonym for \"lantern.\"\n\nAlso, \"rowing\" is a closer translation of the word \"\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0431\u043b\u044e\" than \"rapids\" in T1, and T1 is missing a translation of a \"\u0441\u0432\u0435\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\" word combo whereas T2 actually does translate that as \"freshness of the flood.\" It doesn't change the meaning of the text but since it is there in the original piece, it's good to include that."]}, "id": "RD0aIA6GHs", "from_name": "comments", "to_name": "src", "type": "textarea", "origin": "manual"}, {"value": {"choices": ["NO, the translations I have chosen is visibly better."]}, "id": "KukID9_Qdd", "from_name": "DifficultToChoose", "to_name": "src", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}, {"value": {"choices": ["NEITHER of the translations add or omit information that significantly change the meaning of the text"]}, "id": "3XtLpXl_I7", "from_name": "AdditionOmission", "to_name": "src", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}, {"value": {"start": 782, "end": 786, "text": "deaf", "labels": ["MISTRANSLATION"]}, "id": "qNTNFOe9PF", "from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2023-02-21T18:10:26.042314Z", "updated_at": "2023-03-13T10:33:39.281695Z", "lead_time": 1402.4609999999998, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "task": 2835, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null}], "file_upload": "83b76533-translations_DAVINCI_vs_GTr_merged_test_-_ru_en_1.csv", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"id": 282, "langId": 42, "sent#": 6, "book": "the_story_of_a_life", "author": "konstantin_paustovsky", "source": "\u041d\u043e\u0447\u044c\u044e \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u043c \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0433\u0443 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u0438 \u043a\u0442\u043e-\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b \u043c\u0430\u0445\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0444\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043c \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u044f\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c. \u042f \u0432\u044b\u0448\u0435\u043b \u0441 \u0434\u044f\u0434\u0435\u0439 \u0418\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0433. \u0420\u0435\u043a\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0430. \u0412\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0448\u043b\u0430 \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437 \u0433\u0440\u0435\u0431\u043b\u044e \u0445\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0432\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043c. \u041d\u043e\u0447\u044c \u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u043b\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0437\u0434\u043d\u044f\u044f, \u0433\u043b\u0443\u0445\u0430\u044f, \u043d\u0438 \u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0437\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u044b \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0434 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439. \u0412 \u043b\u0438\u0446\u043e \u0434\u0443\u043b\u043e \u0434\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430, \u043e\u0442\u0442\u0430\u044f\u0432\u0448\u0435\u0439 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438. \u0418 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u043a\u0442\u043e-\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0445\u0430\u043b \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u043c \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0433\u0443 \u0444\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043c \u0438 \u043a\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0430\u043b, \u043d\u043e \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432 \u0437\u0430 \u0448\u0443\u043c\u043e\u043c \u0440\u0435\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0437\u044f \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c.", "source_lang": "ru", "target": "That night someone on the other side of the river began yelling and waving a lantern.

That's right, we haven't seen each other. Ostap began to go blind. Then he decided to go to Petersburg to see that woman, while he was not yet completely blind. He reached the royal capital and found out that she had died - perhaps she could not stand the separation. Ostap found her grave made of white marble-stone in the cemetery, looked, and his heart broke - his iron rose lay on the stone. That woman bequeathed to put a rose on her grave. Forever. And Ostap began to liar and, maybe, he died on the highway or in the market under a cart.
